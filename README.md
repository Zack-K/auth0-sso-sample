# SSO sample

This is the example for the [SSO article](https://docs.auth0.com/sso/single-sign-on). In here, you'll see how to implement SSO between Single Page Apps and Regular Web Apps using Auth0.

## Structure

In this example, we have 3 applications:

* app1.com (single page app)
* app2.com (single page app)
* app3.com (regular web app)

Each application has its own folder in this repository with its own instructions on how to run it. 

## Running

In order to be able to test SSO correctly, each application must have its own domain. For that, you can edit your `/etc/hosts` and make app1.com, app2.com and app3.com all point to `127.0.0.1`.

For that, open `/etc/hosts` and edits as follows:

````
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1 localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost 
# ...
127.0.0.1 app1.com
127.0.0.1 app2.com
127.0.0.1 app3.com
````

Once that's done, just run all 3 applications (See specific instructions on each README) and go to [`app1.com:3000`](http://app1.com:3000) to start using the applications :).

## Learning

To learn more about how this 3 apps work with SSO, please read the [SSO article](https://docs.auth0.com/sso/single-sign-on) from our docs.
